# Version 2.99.99

This version exists just so that libraries that add random_compat with
the `^2` string, but are used on PHP 7 projects, can avoid ever loading
unnecessary code that breaks e.g. PHPStorm inspections.

You probably want the [latest version](https://github.com/paragonie/random_compat/releases)
instead of this one.
